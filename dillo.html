            Dillo Day is an annual music event held at Northwestern University. It is the nations
            largest student-led music festival and it is completely organized by Mayfest Productions,
            an organization on campus. As part of the Tech Team, I was among a group of 4 that designed
            and created the Dillo Day App. It is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play Store.
