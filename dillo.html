            Dillo Day is an annual music event held at Northwestern University. It is the nations
            largest student-led music festival and it is completely run by Mayfest Productions,
            an organization on campus. As part of the Tech Team, I was among a group of 4 that designed
            and created the Dillo Day App. The app contained the artist lineup/schedule for the festival
            and a map of the stage performances. The app also enabled push notifications and an emergency number hotline.
            It was made using Typescript, React Native, and Firebase.
            It is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play Store.
