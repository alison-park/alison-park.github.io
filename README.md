Project Description:

This website was designed for CS_330: Human Computer Interaction as the course's final project. It includes 1 main landing page that is coded in the index.html file. This main
page is partitioned into 3 sections that can be navigated by 3 different ways.
1. Pressing the Title of the page in the Navigation Bar Header
2. Scrolling through the Home page
3. By using the Tab button on the keyboard.

The website includes a Contact Information button on the Home page. 
Once clicked, this button opens a modal pop up that contains my email and phone number.
The user can exit the modal by clicking the 'X' button on the top right of the pop up
or the user can press the Tab button once and press enter.

The website includes a photo of myself and a short bio of my interests.

The website includes 2 projects that I have previously worked on, the Dillo Day App and my Generative Art.

The website also links to a PDF of my Resume.
